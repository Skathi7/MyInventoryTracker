# About 
This program is still in the works and is an ongoing project. So far, the main frame is created with the panels, the Home button works and the Manage button works. 

The current goal of this inventory program is that the user will be able to manage their inventory(add, remove modify), and display current inventory.  This will be connected to its own database.
